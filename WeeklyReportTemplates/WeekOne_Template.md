Daily work
----------

> In the past, this class has been pretty time consuming for some students.  To help me understand better where the class is at in terms of workload, I'd like to try keeping time diaries that document the out-of-class time you spend on this class.  To the best of your ability, try to document how much time you spent on work for this class, and what tasks you spent that time on.  I've included a few sample entries to show how things might look. (We'll keep doing this in weeks ahead, so if you want to pull down the template for week two and start recording your time there as the week goes on, that may save you some time at the end of next week!)
